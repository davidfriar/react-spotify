# Spotify API Hooks
This is a set of React hooks that make it easy to interact with the Spotify Web API. It includes hooks for many, but not all, of the API endpoints, as well as providing convenient ways to authenticate and to include the web player provided by the Spotify Playback SDK on a page.

At this moment, this is an alpha release and I do not recommend that you use this package. It is likely to have unnresolved issues and the code is subject to change without warning from one version to the next, without any regard to backwards compatibility.
